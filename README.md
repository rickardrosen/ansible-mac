# Get started with your mac by cloning this repo (git is available by default) and running the following commands
# 1. sudo easy_install pip
# 2. sudo pip install ansible
# 3. ansible-playbook devpc.yml (alternately 'ansible-playbook devpc.yml -e "i_am_a_pilot=true"' if you want Apples default unnatural scroll)
